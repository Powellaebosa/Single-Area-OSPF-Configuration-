# Single-Area-OSPF-Configuration-
In this project demonstrates the configuration of OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) in a single area (Area 0) across three routers — Boise, Toledo, and Naperville — with the goal of enabling full inter-LAN communication and external Internet access via a default route. This lab is modeled on real-world enterprise routing infrastructure.
